## Task description:

In the picture you see below there are 7 wheels. On each wheel there are six colors in a different order, which means that the order of colors (looking clockwise) is different.  
The colors are green,black,yellow,blue,red,white (same colors on all wheel, just different order on each).  

The wheels are numbered in the picture as number 1 to number 7. Number 1 is the most left wheel, and 7 is the most right wheel.  
In the middle of each wheel there is a hole, to place the wheel on a pin of a wood plate as seen in the picture.  
So you should place the seven wheels on the seven pins in a specific order to solve the problem.

Please write a code (with any convenient for you language )  which will solve the way the wheels should be placed on the plate in order to have the following: Each wheel, on each touch point with another wheel, is touching it with the same color.  
As an example (which is not a part of the real solution), I have placed 5 wheels , where each of them is touching the other on the same color.  
You can see below that the two wheels that are left outside the example canâ€™t match the required colors on the other wheels , so it is not the right solution.

Please write a code (with any convenient for you language ) which will solve and find the right order of the wheels.  

As a solution, I would like to get from you :  

* Which wheel number is the central wheel ?  
* What is the order of the other wheels around the central wheel ?  
* What wheel number is touching the black color of the central wheel ?
